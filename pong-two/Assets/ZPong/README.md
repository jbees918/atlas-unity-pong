### Code Overview

#### GameManager

Manages the game's state, including the ball's lifecycle and goals. Ensures that the game starts, pauses, and resets in a manner consistent with gameplay requirements.

#### ScoreManager

Handles scorekeeping for both players and dynamically updates the UI. It also manages the game's winning conditions.

#### Ball

Controls the movement, collision detection, and audio cues for the ball. The ball is the central element in Pong, and this class handles its behavior comprehensively.

#### Player

Responsible for player-specific logic, including movement and key customization.

**Key Methods:**

- `Start()`: Initializes the paddle and sets up input keys based on PlayerPrefs.
- `Update()`: Manages vertical input for paddle movement.

#### VolumeControl

Handles the audio channels' volume levels in the game (Master, Music, SFX). The volume control employs a perceptually linear mapping technique for a better user experience.

#### Paddle

Manages the behavior and attributes of each paddle. It also supports dynamic resizing based on user preferences.

**Key Methods:**

- `Start()`: Initializes the paddle size based on PlayerPrefs.
- `Move(float movement)`: Moves the paddle vertically, ensuring it stays within screen bounds.

#### Goal

Sets up the dimensions of the goal areas, where scoring occurs.

**Key Methods:**

- `Start()`: Initializes the collider dimensions based on UI height.
- `SetHeightBounds()`: Dynamically adjusts height bounds.

#### SettingsMenuUI

Manages the functionalities of the settings menu, including UI interactivity and game settings application.

**Key Features:**

- Configurable AI difficulty levels
- Customizable ball and paddle attributes
- Advanced volume control

#### UIScaler

A singleton class that manages the UI elements' scaling in the game.

**Key Methods:**

- `GetUIHeight()`: Returns the UI height.
- `GetUIHeightPadded()`: Returns the UI height with padding.

#### BackgroundMusic

Manages the game's background music, providing seamless transitions between tracks based on the game scene.

**Key Methods:**

- `PlayNextTrack()`: Plays the next track in the playlist.
- `StopBackgroundMusic()`: Stops all background music.
- `ResumeBackgroundMusic()`: Resumes playing background music.

---

### Customization

- You can adjust the `winningScore` in the `ScoreManager` to set the score required to win.
- The ball's speed can be adjusted via the `speed` variable in the `Ball` script. Note: This may also require adjusting other gameplay elements.
- Volume levels can be adjusted in the `VolumeControl` script, with options for different curves for volume mapping.

---

### Challenges

1. Implement additional gameplay features like power-ups or obstacles. (Hint: Look into modifying the `Ball` class for this)
2. Add more audio cues or background music options.
3. Create a more complex UI for gameplay customization.
